# 1. PRE-OPERATIONAL (Generate / Register)
## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Key Generation  

Key generation begins with **randomness**, which is essential for secure cryptographic keys. This randomness comes from a **seed**, which forms the foundation of the key generation process.

---

### 1.1 Seed & Entropy Collection  

#### What Collecting Entropy Means
- **Entropy = unpredictability**.  
- Gathering unpredictable bits from events or hardware to form a seed that no one can guess.

#### Entropy Sources

**a) Operating System Sources**  
- **Linux/Unix:** `/dev/random`, `/dev/urandom`, `getrandom()`  
  - Kernel collects random events (mouse movement, disk activity, CPU timings).  
  - `/dev/random` blocks until enough entropy is available.  
  - `/dev/urandom` uses the same pool + PRNG internally and never blocks.  
- **Windows:** `CryptGenRandom()`, `BCryptGenRandom()` combine many system sources automatically.

**b) Hardware RNG / TRNG Chips**  
- CPU instructions: **Intel RDRAND**, **AMD RDSEED**.  
- External security chips: TPM, ATECC608, Infineon TPM.  
- Sources include thermal noise, clock jitter, quantum effects.

**c) TPM (Trusted Platform Module)**  
- **TPM 2.0 GetRandom** command provides entropy from its own internal sources.

**d) External / Dedicated TRNG Devices**  
- USB dongles, PCI cards, quantum RNGs (e.g., ID Quantique QRNG).

**e) User or System Activity**  
- Mouse movement patterns, key press timings.  
- Network packet arrival timings, microcontroller sensor noise.

#### Conditioning / Mixing Entropy
- Raw entropy may be biased.  
- Use cryptographic hash (SHA-256, SHA-3) or block cipher in CBC-MAC mode to ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù randomness.  
- Example: collect 512 bits ‚Üí SHA-512 ‚Üí output as seed.

#### Building the Seed from Multiple Sources
- Combine multiple entropy sources for stronger security:  

seed = Hash( TRNG_output || TPM_random || /dev/random_output )



####  Checking Entropy Quality

- Use OS-provided health checks.  
- For hardware RNGs, follow **NIST SP 800-90B** tests:  
  - Repetition test  
  - Adaptive proportion test


#### Reseeding (Refreshing)

- Collect fresh entropy periodically.  
- Feed it back into PRNG/DRBG to refresh internal state.  
- Protects against state compromise even if PRNG state is exposed.

---

### 1.2 Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG)

#### Definition
- Produces sequences that appear random but are **completely determined by an initial seed**.

#### Characteristics
- Deterministic (same seed ‚Üí same sequence)  
- Fast and scalable for generating large amounts of random data  
- Commonly used for generating keys, IVs, and nonces

#### Example in Cryptography
- **Stream Cipher:**  
  - Key stream generated from PRNG  
  - Plaintext ‚äï Key Stream = Ciphertext (XOR)

#### Why PRNG is Preferred
- TRNG too slow for large volumes of random data  
- Hardware TRNG not always available  
- TRNG is costly and complex to build/maintain  
- Raw TRNG output may be biased (needs whitening)  
- PRNG easily scalable for high-demand cryptographic systems

---

### 1.3 True Random Number Generator (TRNG / HRNG-Hardware random number generator)

### Definition
- Generates numbers from **physical processes** instead of deterministic algorithms

### Entropy Sources
- Atmospheric noise  
- Thermal noise  
- Radioactive decay  
- Quantum effects

### Features
- Truly random and unpredictable output  
- Used to generate high-entropy seeds

---

## Putting It All Together

1. Collect entropy from OS, hardware, TPM, or user/system activity  
2. Optionally mix entropy using SHA-256, SHA-3, or CBC-MAC to remove bias  
3. Feed mixed value into PRNG/DRBG ‚Äî this becomes the seed  
4. Generate cryptographic keys, IVs, or salts from PRNG output  
5. Reseed periodically with new entropy to refresh PRNG state

### 1.4 Key Generation Considerations

Key generation is the foundation of secure cryptography. This process ensures that cryptographic keys are unpredictable, unique, and strong enough to protect sensitive data. The following practices are generally recommended:



#### 1.Entropy Source Validation
- **Purpose:** Ensure that the randomness used to generate keys is truly unpredictable.  
- **How:** Use hardware RNGs, TRNGs, or operating system entropy pools.  
- **Validation Standard:** Follow NIST SP 800-90B tests (e.g., repetition test, adaptive proportion test) to confirm high-quality entropy.  
- **Reason:** Low-quality entropy can make keys predictable, compromising security.



#### 2. Choosing Appropriate Key Size
- **A (Symmetric Keys):** 128, 192, 256 bits  
- **RSA / Asymmetric Keys:** 2048, 3072, 4096 bits  
- **Guidelines:**  
  - Larger keys ‚Üí stronger security, slower performance  
  - Smaller keys ‚Üí faster, but weaker protection  
- **Reason:** The key size must balance **security requirements** with **system performance**.



#### 3. Key Derivation
- **Purpose:** Generate session or derived keys from a master key or password.  
- **Techniques:**  
  - HKDF (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function)  
  - PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2)  
- **Reason:** Ensures derived keys remain independent and secure, even if the master key is reused.



#### 4. Use Strong, Compliant Algorithms
- **Recommended Algorithms:**  
  - AES-256 for symmetric encryption  
  - FIPS-approved cryptographic primitives  
- **Reason:** Compliance with recognized standards ensures the algorithm is secure against known attacks.



#### 5. Ensure Uniqueness of Keys
- **Purpose:** Each key should be unique to prevent accidental collisions or reuse.  
- **Implementation:** Track key identifiers and verify that new keys do not repeat existing ones.  
- **Reason:** Reusing keys across sessions or systems increases the risk of cryptanalysis and breaches.



#### 6. Secure Generation Environment
- **Tools:** HSM (Hardware Security Module), TPM (Trusted Platform Module)  
- **Purpose:** Protect the key from exposure during generation.  
- **Reason:** Keys generated in secure hardware are resistant to theft or tampering.



#### 7. Compliance Tags
- **Purpose:** Label keys according to regulatory or organizational requirements.  
- **Examples:** FIPS, GDPR, PCI DSS  
- **Reason:** Helps enforce policy compliance and track the usage of keys within regulated environments.



#### 8. Secure Audit Trail
- **Purpose:** Maintain tamper-evident logs of all key generation events.  
- **What to Record:**  
  - Who generated the key  
  - When it was generated  
  - Key type and attributes  
- **Reason:** Supports accountability, forensic investigation, and regulatory compliance.



#### 9. Record Key Attributes
- **Key Details to Record:**  
  - Name or identifier  
  - Creation date  
  - Cryptoperiod (validity period)  
  - Associated policies  
- **Reason:** Helps manage key lifecycle, enforce rotation policies, and prevent accidental misuse.
