# Key Exchange (KEX) 

## 1. Introduction / Definition
Key exchange (also called key establishment or key negotiation) is a fundamental cryptographic method by which two or more parties securely establish a shared secret key over an insecure communication channel.  

The key exchange process serves as the foundation for virtually all secure communications in modern computing, allowing parties who have never met before to establish encrypted connections over networks like the internet.

## 1.1 Why We Need Key Exchange (KEX)
- **Asymmetric encryption is secure but slow.**  
- **Symmetric encryption is fast but requires a shared key.**  
- **Key Exchange (KEX) bridges the gap:**  
  Use asymmetric cryptography to safely share a symmetric session key, then communicate efficiently using fast symmetric encryption.

## 2. Background / Motivation
The need for key exchange arose from the "key distribution problem" in cryptography.  
- Symmetric keys require secure pre-sharing.  
- Early methods: couriers, diplomatic channels (impractical for large-scale digital communications).  
- Breakthrough: 1976 Diffie-Hellman protocol allowed shared secret over public channel.  
- Motivation includes:
  - Scalable security
  - Dynamic key generation
  - Global connectivity
  - Forward secrecy

## 3. Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Key Systems

### 3.1 Symmetric Key Systems
- Single key for encryption/decryption  
- Fast and efficient  
- Key distribution challenge  
- Examples: AES, ChaCha20, 3DES

### 3.2 Asymmetric Key Systems
- Public/private key pair  
- No pre-shared secrets  
- Slower, larger key sizes  
- Dual functionality (encryption + digital signature)  
- Examples: RSA, ECC

### 3.3 Hybrid Approaches
- Use asymmetric cryptography for key exchange  
- Use symmetric cryptography for data encryption

## 4. Importance of Key Exchange
- **Security Foundation**: Cornerstone of secure communications  
- **Scalability**: Enables billions of secure connections  
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Protects past communications  
- **Authentication Integration**: Prevents MITM attacks

## 5. Types of Key Exchange

### 5A. Classical KEX
- **RSA Key Exchange**: Encrypt random symmetric key with recipient's public key  
- **Diffie-Hellman (DH)**: Shared secret via discrete logarithm problem  
- **Elliptic Curve DH (ECDH)**: Smaller key sizes, more efficient

### 5B. Public-Key Based KEX
- **Key Transport**: Sender encrypts session key with recipientâ€™s public key  
- **Key Agreement**: Both parties contribute to shared secret  
- **Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE)**: Prevents impersonation attacks

### 5C. Post-Quantum KEX
- **ML-KEM (Kyber)**: Lattice-based, quantum-resistant  
- **Learning With Errors (LWE)**: Hard problem secure against quantum attacks  
- **Hash-Based Signatures**: Authentication using hash function security

### 5D. Hybrid KEX
- **Classical + Post-Quantum**: Combines ECDH + Kyber  
- **Algorithm Negotiation**: Parties select mutually supported algorithms  
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Interoperability with legacy systems

## 6. Step-by-Step Example: Diffieâ€“Hellman

### 6.1 Setup Phase
- Public parameters agreed upon:  
  - `p`: large prime modulus  
  - `g`: generator (primitive root modulo `p`)

### 6.2 Key Generation
- Private keys:  
  - Alice: `a`  
  - Bob: `b`  
- Public keys:  
  - Alice: `A = g^a mod p`  
  - Bob: `B = g^b mod p`

### 6.3 Key Exchange
- Alice and Bob exchange `A` and `B` over the insecure channel.

### 6.4 Shared Secret Generation
- Alice computes: `s = B^a mod p`  
- Bob computes: `s = A^b mod p`  
- Both derive the same secret `s`.

### 6.5 Mathematical Verification
- Since `ab = ba`, `g^(ab) mod p` is identical for both parties.

### 6.6 Security
- Eavesdropper knows `p`, `g`, `A`, `B`.  
- Computing `s` requires solving the **discrete logarithm problem**, infeasible for large `p`.

## 7. Simple Key Exchange Protocol Examples

### 7.1 KEX with KDC (Kerberos / SSO)
- **Setup:** A trusted Key Distribution Center (KDC) manages and distributes session keys.  
- **Steps:**
  1. Client authenticates with KDC using a long-term secret key.  
  2. KDC generates a **session key** for the client and server.  
  3. KDC sends the session key to both client and server, encrypted with their respective long-term keys.  
  4. Client and server use the session key to communicate securely.  
- **Use Case:** Single Sign-On (SSO), enterprise environments, centralized authentication.  
- **Benefit:** Centralized management; avoids repeatedly exchanging keys over the network.

### 7.2 KEX without KDC
- **Setup:** No trusted third party; parties establish keys directly.  
- **Example Protocol:** Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange.  
- **Steps:**
  1. Parties agree on public parameters (`p`, `g`).  
  2. Each selects a private key (`a` and `b`).  
  3. Exchange public values (`A = g^a mod p`, `B = g^b mod p`).  
  4. Compute shared secret: `s = B^a mod p = A^b mod p`.  
- **Use Case:** Peer-to-peer communication, ad-hoc networks.  
- **Benefit:** No need for a trusted third party; forward secrecy achievable with ephemeral keys.
