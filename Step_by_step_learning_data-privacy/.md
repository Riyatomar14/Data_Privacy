# üîë Key Life Cycle & Entropy Collection  

A secure cryptographic system starts with **randomness**. This document explains how keys are generated, what seeds and entropy are, and how to collect, mix, and manage entropy for strong cryptography.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Key Generation  

Key generation begins with **randomness**, which is essential for secure cryptographic keys. This randomness comes from a **seed**, which forms the foundation of the key generation process.

### 1.1 Seed & Entropy Collection  

#### What Collecting Entropy Means
- **Entropy = unpredictability**.  
- Gathering unpredictable bits from events or hardware to form a seed that no one can guess.

#### Entropy Sources

**a) Operating System Sources**  
- **Linux/Unix:** `/dev/random`, `/dev/urandom`, `getrandom()`  
  - Kernel collects random events (mouse movement, disk activity, CPU timings).  
  - `/dev/random` blocks until enough entropy is available.  
  - `/dev/urandom` uses the same pool + PRNG internally and never blocks.  
- **Windows:** `CryptGenRandom()`, `BCryptGenRandom()` combine many system sources automatically.

**b) Hardware RNG / TRNG Chips**  
- CPU instructions: **Intel RDRAND**, **AMD RDSEED**.  
- External security chips: TPM, ATECC608, Infineon TPM.  
- Sources include thermal noise, clock jitter, quantum effects.

**c) TPM (Trusted Platform Module)**  
- **TPM 2.0 GetRandom** command provides entropy from its own internal sources.

**d) External / Dedicated TRNG Devices**  
- USB dongles, PCI cards, quantum RNGs (e.g., ID Quantique QRNG).

**e) User or System Activity**  
- Mouse movement patterns, key press timings.  
- Network packet arrival timings, microcontroller sensor noise.

#### Conditioning / Mixing Entropy
- Raw entropy may be biased.  
- Use cryptographic hash (SHA-256, SHA-3) or block cipher in CBC-MAC mode to ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù randomness.  
- Example: collect 512 bits ‚Üí SHA-512 ‚Üí output as seed.

#### Building the Seed from Multiple Sources
- Combine multiple entropy sources for stronger security:  
```text
seed = Hash( TRNG_output || TPM_random || /dev/random_output )
```


####  Checking Entropy Quality

- Use OS-provided health checks.  
- For hardware RNGs, follow **NIST SP 800-90B** tests:  
  - Repetition test  
  - Adaptive proportion test


#### Reseeding (Refreshing)

- Collect fresh entropy periodically.  
- Feed it back into PRNG/DRBG to refresh internal state.  
- Protects against state compromise even if PRNG state is exposed.

### 1.2 Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG)

#### Definition
- Produces sequences that appear random but are **completely determined by an initial seed**.

#### Characteristics
- Deterministic (same seed ‚Üí same sequence)  
- Fast and scalable for generating large amounts of random data  
- Commonly used for generating keys, IVs, and nonces

#### Example in Cryptography
- **Stream Cipher:**  
  - Key stream generated from PRNG  
  - Plaintext ‚äï Key Stream = Ciphertext (XOR)

#### Why PRNG is Preferred
- TRNG too slow for large volumes of random data  
- Hardware TRNG not always available  
- TRNG is costly and complex to build/maintain  
- Raw TRNG output may be biased (needs whitening)  
- PRNG easily scalable for high-demand cryptographic systems

### 1.3 True Random Number Generator (TRNG / HRNG-Hardware random number generator)

### Definition
- Generates numbers from **physical processes** instead of deterministic algorithms

### Entropy Sources
- Atmospheric noise  
- Thermal noise  
- Radioactive decay  
- Quantum effects

### Features
- Truly random and unpredictable output  
- Used to generate high-entropy seeds

## Putting It All Together

1. Collect entropy from OS, hardware, TPM, or user/system activity  
2. Optionally mix entropy using SHA-256, SHA-3, or CBC-MAC to remove bias  
3. Feed mixed value into PRNG/DRBG ‚Äî this becomes the seed  
4. Generate cryptographic keys, IVs, or salts from PRNG output  
5. Reseed periodically with new entropy to refresh PRNG state
