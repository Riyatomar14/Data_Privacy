## 1. Key Exchange Primitives
| Keyword                                        | Use Case                                     | Real-Time Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Diffie–Hellman (DH / ECDH)**                 | **HTTPS (when you open `https://bank.com`)** | When you visit `https://bank.com`, your browser and the bank’s server perform a Diffie–Hellman exchange. They agree on a shared secret key that no eavesdropper can compute. This key then encrypts your login and transactions. |
|                                                | **Signal / WhatsApp Chats**                  | When you start a new chat, your phone and your friend’s phone run an ECDH exchange. Both get the same secret key, which encrypts all messages so that even WhatsApp’s servers cannot read them.                                  |
|                                                | **OpenVPN**                                  | When you connect to a VPN, OpenVPN first does a DH exchange between your laptop and the VPN server. That shared key then encrypts all office traffic so hackers on public Wi-Fi see only gibberish.                              |
|                                                | **SSH Login**                                | Before sending your password or keys, SSH uses DH to create a secret session key. That key then encrypts the full session — your typed commands, output, and file transfers — so they remain private.                            |
| **PAKE (Password Authenticated Key Exchange)** | **WPA3 Wi-Fi**                               | When you enter your Wi-Fi password, WPA3 uses PAKE to prove you know the password **without actually sending it**. Even if attackers capture the Wi-Fi handshake, they can’t recover the password.                               |
|                                                | **iCloud Keychain**                          | Apple uses PAKE when syncing passwords between devices. Your iPhone proves it knows your iCloud password without revealing it to Apple’s servers.                                                                                |
|                                                | **Banking PIN Login**                        | Some online banking apps use PAKE so that entering your PIN proves your identity without ever sending the PIN across the network. Even a hacker recording traffic can’t reuse it.                                                |
|                                                | **Microsoft OPAQUE Protocol**                | Microsoft’s OPAQUE login system ensures that passwords are never transmitted directly. It relies on PAKE to authenticate securely against servers.                                                                               |
| **Post-Quantum Key Exchange**                  | **Chrome Kyber (TLS test)**                  | Google Chrome has tested TLS connections using Kyber (a PQC algorithm). Even if someone records your traffic today, a future quantum computer cannot decrypt it.                                                                 |
|                                                | **Cloudflare PQ TLS**                        | Cloudflare protects some HTTPS connections with post-quantum algorithms so websites remain safe against quantum attacks.                                                                                                         |
|                                                | **IBM VPNs**                                 | IBM experiments with PQ key exchange in VPN tunnels to make corporate communications quantum-safe.                                                                                                                               |
|                                                | **Microsoft PQC Adoption**                   | Microsoft is testing PQC in Azure and Windows updates so enterprises can shift to quantum-resistant encryption ahead of time.                                                                                                    |
|                                                | **NIST PQC Standards**                       | NIST is standardizing PQC algorithms (like Kyber and Dilithium). Soon, browsers, banks, and cloud systems will adopt them for everyday use.                                                                                      |

## 2. Signature Schemes

| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Digital Signature**       | **DocuSign**                            | When you sign a contract in DocuSign, the document is digitally signed with your private key. Anyone can verify it was really you and that the document wasn’t changed.                    |
|                             | **SSL/TLS Certificates**                | When you visit `https://amazon.com`, the website presents a certificate digitally signed by a trusted authority. Your browser checks the signature to ensure the site is genuine and safe. |
|                             | **Git Commits**                         | Developers sign their code commits with GPG keys. Anyone pulling the code can verify it was authored by the trusted developer and not tampered with.                                       |
|                             | **App Signing**                         | Every Android/iOS app in the Play Store or App Store is signed by the developer. Your phone verifies the signature before installation to prevent malware.                                 |
|                             | **Blockchain Transactions**             | Bitcoin or Ethereum wallets sign transactions with the user’s private key. The blockchain verifies signatures to ensure only the rightful owner can spend the funds.                       |
| **Group Signature**         | **Consortium Blockchains**              | In a consortium blockchain of multiple banks, any bank can sign a block. Outsiders know it’s signed by a bank, but not which one.                                                          |
|                             | **IoT Devices**                         | In a smart city, IoT devices can issue group signatures so the central server knows “some device in the group” reported data, without knowing which one specifically.                      |
|                             | **Anonymous Surveys**                   | Employees sign surveys using group signatures, proving they belong to the company without revealing who answered.                                                                          |
|                             | **GDPR Logs**                           | A company can log actions with group signatures so regulators know logs came from staff but not which individual (protecting privacy).                                                     |
| **Ring Signature**          | **Monero Cryptocurrency**               | Every Monero transaction is signed with a ring signature. Observers can see it came from a group of possible senders but cannot tell who exactly paid.                                     |
|                             | **SecureDrop**                          | Whistleblowers submit documents using ring signatures. Journalists can verify that the file came from a real whistleblower but cannot know which one.                                      |
|                             | **Anonymous Donations**                 | Ring signatures allow donors to prove they contributed funds without revealing their identity.                                                                                             |
| **Blind Signature**         | **E-Cash**                              | A digital coin request is “blinded” before the bank signs it. The bank issues valid currency without seeing which exact coin it signed.                                                    |
|                             | **Transit Cards**                       | Your metro card may be reloaded using blind signatures so the operator can validate payments without linking transactions to your identity.                                                |
|                             | **Privacy Voting**                      | Voters’ ballots are signed by the election authority without them seeing the contents, ensuring ballot validity while preserving secrecy.                                                  |
|                             | **Exam Grading**                        | Professors can grade exams blind-signed by the university so the grader doesn’t know which student wrote the exam.                                                                         |
| **Threshold Signature**     | **BitGo Wallets**                       | To move funds from a corporate crypto wallet, at least 2 of 3 executives must use their keys. No single person can steal funds.                                                            |
|                             | **DAO Approvals**                       | A DAO may require at least 5 of 9 council members to approve a contract upgrade. Only if the threshold is met will the contract be signed.                                                 |
|                             | **Fireblocks Custody**                  | Enterprises use threshold signatures so customer assets are secured by multiple key holders across locations.                                                                              |
|                             | **Nuclear Codes**                       | Military systems use threshold signatures so that multiple commanders must enter their codes before a launch order is signed.                                                              |
| **Post-Quantum Signatures** | **Dilithium (IBM Demos)**               | IBM uses PQ signatures in blockchain demos to ensure that signatures remain safe against quantum computers.                                                                                |
|                             | **Falcon (Cloudflare DNSSEC PQ Tests)** | Cloudflare tests Falcon for DNSSEC so domain authenticity checks won’t break when quantum computers arrive.                                                                                |

## 3. Mixing Protocols
| Keyword                | Use Case                    | Real-Time Example                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mixers / Tumblers**  | **Tornado Cash (Ethereum)** | Alice sends 1 ETH into Tornado Cash. The system mixes her ETH with hundreds of others. When Bob later withdraws, no one can link Alice’s deposit to Bob’s withdrawal.                       |
|                        | **Wasabi Wallet (Bitcoin)** | Wasabi automatically routes your Bitcoin transaction through a mixer. Even blockchain analysts can’t tell where your payment originated.                                                    |
|                        | **ChipMixer (Bitcoin)**     | Users deposit Bitcoin and receive “chips” of equal amounts. When they withdraw different chips, the link between deposit and withdrawal is broken.                                          |
| **CoinJoin**           | **Wasabi Wallet**           | Multiple users combine their Bitcoin payments into one large transaction. Outsiders see coins moved but cannot link “who paid whom.”                                                        |
|                        | **JoinMarket**              | Several Bitcoin users use JoinMarket to collaborate on a transaction. Each pays less fee and gains privacy since outputs are indistinguishable.                                             |
|                        | **Samurai Wallet**          | Samurai uses CoinJoin to hide sender–receiver links in mobile Bitcoin transactions.                                                                                                         |
| **CoinSwap**           | **Bitcoin Wallet Swaps**    | Alice swaps her coins with Bob. On-chain, it looks like two independent transactions. To an observer, it’s impossible to know a swap occurred.                                              |
|                        | **Lightning Swaps**         | Alice wants to pay Bob in Bitcoin but only has funds on Lightning. A CoinSwap enables Alice to send Lightning BTC while Bob receives on-chain BTC, without outsiders seeing the connection. |
| **CoinShuffle**        | **Dash PrivateSend**        | Dash uses CoinShuffle to break the transaction history. Even if you track coins, you can’t link them back to their original owners.                                                         |
|                        | **Ethereum Experiments**    | Research projects use CoinShuffle on Ethereum to add extra randomness to CoinJoin-like transactions for stronger privacy.                                                                   |
| **Dandelion Protocol** | **Grin (MimbleWimble)**     | When Alice broadcasts a transaction, instead of going straight to the network, it hops randomly through other nodes first, hiding her IP address.                                           |
|                        | **IoT Privacy Research**    | Smart sensors (like traffic cameras) can use Dandelion-like methods so no one can trace which specific sensor sent the data originally.                                                     |

## 4. Conditional Payments & Proofs
| Keyword                                      | Use Case                              | Real-Time Example                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ZKCP (Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payment)** | **Bitcoin trustless payments**        | Alice wants to buy a secret software key from Bob. Using ZKCP, the Bitcoin payment is released **only if** Bob provides the correct key. No middleman or escrow needed, and the process is fully automated and secure. |
| **zk-SNARKs**                                | **Zcash private payments**            | When sending Zcash, your transaction proves that you have enough funds and that the transfer is valid **without revealing the sender, receiver, or amount**. Observers only know a valid transaction occurred.         |

| Level                                        | Use Case                          | Real-Time Example                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Network-Level**                         | **Tor Browser**                   | When you browse with Tor, your traffic is routed through multiple relays worldwide. Websites cannot see your real IP, hiding your location and identity.               |
|                                              | **I2P**                           | Internal messaging within I2P is anonymized by routing through layered encryption tunnels, preventing anyone from tracing the source.                                  |
|                                              | **VPNs**                          | Connecting through a VPN hides your IP from websites and local network observers. For example, a user in India accessing a US website appears as a US IP.              |
|                                              | **Mixnets**                       | Messages are batched and shuffled through servers to prevent traffic analysis. For instance, corporate communication systems use mixnets for confidential memos.       |
| **2. Transaction-Level**                     | **Tornado Cash (Ethereum)**       | When Alice deposits ETH into Tornado Cash, it gets mixed with others. Bob can withdraw the same ETH later, and blockchain observers cannot link deposit to withdrawal. |
|                                              | **CoinJoin (Bitcoin)**            | Multiple Bitcoin transactions are combined into one large transaction. Outsiders cannot determine which sender corresponds to which receiver.                          |
|                                              | **Monero**                        | Uses ring signatures and stealth addresses to hide sender, receiver, and amount, making transactions untraceable.                                                      |
|                                              | **Zcash**                         | Shielded Zcash transactions conceal both the sender and receiver while still being validated by the network.                                                           |
| **3. Signature-Level**                       | **Group Signatures**              | Employees sign internal audit logs as a group. Regulators know the log is valid but not which employee signed it.                                                      |
|                                              | **Ring Signatures**               | Whistleblowers submit documents anonymously. The signature proves it came from a group member but hides the exact signer.                                              |
|                                              | **Blind Signatures**              | Voters submit blind-signed ballots. Election authority validates them without knowing who voted.                                                                       |
|                                              | **Threshold Signatures**          | Multi-key approval systems (e.g., crypto wallets) hide which exact combination of participants signed a transaction.                                                   |
| **4. Function-Level**                        | **PRFs (Pseudorandom Functions)** | A server can generate random-looking session keys for your connection. Only the server can reproduce them, keeping operations private.                                 |
|                                              | **OPRF (Oblivious PRF)**          | Used in private set intersection. For example, Facebook can check if a user belongs to a target audience without learning the rest of their data.                      |
|                                              | **PSI for Ads**                   | Companies verify overlapping customers without sharing their full user lists, protecting individual privacy.                                                           |
| **5. PETs (Privacy-Enhancing Technologies)** | **ZK Proofs**                     | ZK proofs allow proving you are eligible for a service (e.g., over 18) without revealing your exact age or identity.                                                   |
|                                              | **MPC (Multi-Party Computation)** | Multiple parties compute a joint result (like average salary) without revealing individual inputs.                                                                     |
|                                              | **Homomorphic Encryption**        | Enables cloud AI to process encrypted data (like medical records) without ever seeing the raw data.                                                                    |
|                                              | **OnionShare**                    | Allows sharing files via Tor securely. Only the recipient can download the file; no server or network observer knows what is being shared.                             |

## 8. Confidentiality Approaches
| Area                          | Use Case                                    | Real-Time Example                                                                                                                                                                              |
