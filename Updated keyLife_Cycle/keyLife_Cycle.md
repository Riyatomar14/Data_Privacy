## Types of Keys (with related terms)

### ðŸ”¹ Symmetric Key
- **Definition:** One secret key for both encryption and decryption.  
- **Examples:** AES, DES, 3DES

- **PPK (Pre-Placed Key):** Symmetric key placed beforehand on both sides for secure communication in isolated networks.  
- **RPC (Remote Procedure Call â€“ secured with symmetric key):** A method where one system calls a function on another over a network, and the communication is protected using pre-shared or pre-placed symmetric keys.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Asymmetric Key
- **Definition:** Two keys â€“ Public (share) + Private (keep secret).  
- **Examples:** RSA, ECC  
- **Use Case:** Secure key exchange, authentication, digital signatures.  

**Related Terms:**

#### 4. Key Usage

**Purpose:** The key usage phase is where a cryptographic key performs its designated function securely.  

**Functionality:**  
- Keys are used to **encrypt/decrypt data**, **sign/verify messages**, or **agree on a shared secret** for secure communication.  
- The **algorithm used depends on the function**:  
  - **Encryption/Decryption:** AES, RSA, ChaCha20  
  - **Digital Signing / Verification:** ECDSA, RSA-PSS  
  - **Key Agreement / Exchange:** ECDH, Diffieâ€“Hellman  


**Hashing Algorithms**
- **Purpose:** Ensure data integrity; produce a unique, fixed-size hash from any input.  
- **Note:** Hashing does **not use a key** directly but is essential in many cryptographic operations (signatures, HMAC, KDFs).  
- **Examples:** SHA-256, SHA-3, BLAKE2  
- **Important Feature:** Detects data tampering; output is deterministic and collision-resistant.  



**Key Derivation Functions (KDFs)**
- **Purpose:** Transform passwords or passphrases into strong cryptographic keys; strengthen keys against brute-force attacks.  
- **Examples:** PBKDF2, scrypt, Argon2 (recommended standard)  
- **Important Feature:** Adds computational cost to attacks; ensures consistent and secure key material.  



** Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD)**
- **Purpose:** Combine **confidentiality (encryption)** and **integrity (authentication)** in a single operation.  
- **Examples:** AES-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode), ChaCha20-Poly1305  
- **Important Feature:** Prevents tampering while keeping data confidential; modern secure standard for symmetric encryption.

#### 5. Key Rotation / Renewal

**Purpose:**  
- Replace old or potentially compromised keys with new ones to reduce exposure.  
- Maintain cryptographic security over time.  
- Ensure **Forward Secrecy**: previous session keys remain secure even if long-term keys are compromised.  

**Algorithm / Method:**  
- **Symmetric Keys:** AES, 3DES, ChaCha20 rekeying  
- **Asymmetric Keys:** RSA, ECC key pair regeneration

- Ensures compliance with security policies and regulations  
- Provides **Forward Secrecy**, protecting historical data from retroactive decryption  

**Consequence if skipped:**  
- Old keys remain valid and vulnerable  
- Past communications may be exposed if long-term keys are compromised  
- Non-compliance with organizational or regulatory security standards
---

#### 6. Key Archiving

**Purpose:**  
- Store keys that are no longer actively used but may be needed for future operations, compliance, or auditing.  
- Preserve the ability to decrypt historical data or validate past digital signatures.  

**Algorithm / Method:**  
- Archived keys, known as **Data Encryption Keys (DEKs)**, are **encrypted with a KEK (Key Encryption Key)** before storage.

- Secure key wrapping ensures DEKs are protected by the KEK.  
- Access is **restricted and logged** to prevent unauthorized retrieval.

#### 7. Key Revocation

**Purpose:**  
- Invalidate keys that are compromised, expired, or no longer needed.  
- Prevent further use of a key in cryptographic operations to maintain security.  

**Algorithm / Method:**  
- **Symmetric Keys:** Mark as inactive in KMS, Vaults, or application keystore.  
- **Asymmetric Keys:** Revoke via **PKI mechanisms**, CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists), or OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol).
