# Key Management Lifecycle
##  The Seed — Where It All Begins
Every secure cryptographic system starts with **randomness** — and at the heart of that is the **seed**.  
A **seed** is the first unpredictable value that drives a **Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)** or feeds into a **Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG)**.  

Key characteristics of a good seed:
- **High entropy:** unpredictable, ideally from TRNG/QRNG or TPM.
- **Unique:** never reuse seeds between systems.
- **Protected:** store and handle like a cryptographic key.
- **Refreshed:** reseed periodically to maintain unpredictability.
  
## 1. PRE-OPERATIONAL (Plan / Generate / Register)
**Purpose:** Prepare and register keys before actual use.

### Key Generation
- Create cryptographic keys using **secure random sources**:
  - **TRNG** – True Random Number Generator  
  - **PRNG** – Pseudo-Random Number Generator  
  - **QRNG** – Quantum Random Number Generator
- **Entropy Source Validation:** Ensure entropy quality is tested (e.g., NIST SP 800-90B).  
- **Choose appropriate key size**:
  - AES: 128, 192, 256-bit  
  - RSA: 2048, 3072, 4096-bit  
  - Larger key → stronger security, slower; smaller → faster, weaker
- **Key Derivation:** Use KDFs (HKDF, PBKDF2) for session or derived keys.  
- Use strong, **compliant algorithms** (AES-256, FIPS-approved).  
- Ensure **uniqueness** of keys.  
- Use **HSMs or TPM (Trusted Platform Module)** for secure generation.  
- **Compliance Tags:** Label keys with FIPS, GDPR, PCI DSS, etc.  
- **Secure Audit Trail:** Log generation events using tamper-evident mechanisms.  
- Record **key attributes**: name, ID, creation date, cryptoperiod (validity).

### Key Registration
- Add keys to **KMS (Key Management System)** or **HSM/TPM inventory**.  
- Assign **ownership** and **access rights**.  
- **Metadata Extensions:**
  - Cryptographic algorithm & mode (AES-GCM, RSA-OAEP)  
  - Key usage flags (encrypt-only, sign-only)  
  - Lifecycle state (active, suspended, expired)  
- **Policy Binding:** Use policy engines or templates to enforce lifecycle rules.

# KEX
## 🔑 Key Exchange (KEX)

Key Exchange (also called **Key Establishment**) is the process in cryptography by which **cryptographic keys are securely exchanged** between two parties, allowing them to use a cryptographic algorithm safely.

### 🔹 Background
Historically, before the invention of public-key cryptography (asymmetric cryptography), **symmetric-key cryptography** required both parties to share a **single secret key**.  
The problem: that secret key itself had to be communicated securely (trusted couriers, diplomatic bags, secure channels), otherwise it could be intercepted. Without a secure initial exchange, encrypted messages could be compromised.

### 🔹 Modern Approach
**Public-key cryptography** solves this problem with a two-key system:
- A **public key** can be openly shared over non-secure channels.
- A **private key** stays secret with its owner.
- Depending on the algorithm, encryption or decryption is done with the public or private key.

Examples:
- **RSA:** Public key encrypts, private key decrypts.
- **DSA / ECDSA:** Private key signs, public key verifies.

### 🔹 Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE)
Diffie–Hellman is the classic KEX mechanism:
1. Each party generates a **public/private key pair**.
2. Each party exchanges only the **public key**.
3. Each party computes a **shared secret locally** (using its private key and the other’s public key).
4. This **shared secret** becomes the **session key** (or is passed into a KDF).

Key benefits of DHKE:
- **No secret key transmitted directly.**
- **Shared secret computed offline.**
- **Forward secrecy** when using ephemeral keys.

### 🔹 Symmetric vs. Asymmetric in KEX
- **Symmetric systems:** Both sides need the **same secret key** to encrypt/decrypt. This requires secure pre-sharing.
- **Asymmetric systems:** Each side only needs the **other party’s public key**. The private key stays hidden.

### 🔹 Why KEX Matters
- It enables **secure communication over insecure channels**.
- It’s a **building block** for protocols like **TLS**, **SSH**, **IPsec**.
- It allows creation of **session keys** dynamically without manual exchange.

# Key Exchange Protocols 

## 1️. Classical Key Exchange
- **Diffie–Hellman (DH):**  
  - Classic key exchange using large primes.  
  - Vulnerable to MITM if unauthenticated.  
  - Used in legacy TLS and VPNs.

- **Ephemeral DH (DHE):**  
  - New key per session → forward secrecy.

- **Elliptic Curve DH (ECDH):**  
  - Uses elliptic curves → smaller keys, faster, secure.  
  - Used in TLS 1.3, SSH, Signal.

- **Ephemeral ECDH (ECDHE):**  
  - Forward secrecy for modern secure protocols.

---

## 2️. Public-Key Based Key Exchange
- **RSA Key Exchange:**  
  - Encrypts session key with receiver’s public key.  
  - Used in older TLS versions.

- **RSA-KEM:**  
  - Key Encapsulation Mechanism using RSA.  
  - Encapsulates session key → secure delivery.

---

## 3️. Post-Quantum Key Exchange (PQ-KEX)
- **Kyber:** Lattice-based, NIST finalist, fast, quantum-resistant.  
- **NewHope:** Ring-LWE, experimental, tested in TLS research.  
- **FrodoKEM:** LWE-based, conservative, slower but robust.

---

## 4️. Hybrid Key Exchange
- Combines classical + post-quantum KEX.  
- Example: **ECDHE + Kyber** → ensures security even if one fails.  
- Used in post-quantum TLS handshakes.

# KEM
# 🔐 Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM)

## 1. Introduction

A **Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM)** is a cryptographic primitive used to securely establish a shared secret key between two parties (**Sender** and **Receiver**). Unlike traditional encryption, KEM focuses only on generating and sharing a session key securely, which can later be used for symmetric encryption of bulk data.

---

## 2. Motivation

* Public-key encryption of large data is inefficient.
* Instead, KEM allows exchanging a short **session key** securely using public-key cryptography.
* Once both parties share the session key, they use **symmetric encryption** (fast, efficient) for actual communication.

---

## 3. KEM Algorithms

A KEM consists of three core algorithms:

### (a) Key Generation — `KeyGen()`

* Run by the **Receiver**.
* Input: Security parameter (λ).
* Output: Public/Private key pair `(pk, sk)`.
* `pk` is shared with Sender; `sk` is kept secret.

### (b) Encapsulation — `Encapsulate(pk)`

* Run by the **Sender** using Receiver's public key.
* Input: `pk`.
* Output: `(c, K)` where:

  * `c` = ciphertext (encapsulation of the key)
  * `K` = session key
* `c` is sent to Receiver; `K` is kept as Sender’s session key.

### (c) Decapsulation — `Decapsulate(c, sk)`

* Run by the **Receiver**.
* Input: Ciphertext `c` and private key `sk`.
* Output: Session key `K`.
* If both sides are correct, Sender’s and Receiver’s `K` match.

---

## 4. KEM Protocol Flow

1. **Receiver → KeyGen()** → `(pk, sk)`
2. **Receiver → publishes pk**
3. **Sender → Encapsulate(pk)** → `(c, K)`
4. **Sender → sends c**
5. **Receiver → Decapsulate(c, sk)** → `K`
6. **Both now share K** (used for symmetric encryption).

---

## 5. Security Properties

* **Confidentiality:** Only Receiver (with `sk`) can recover `K`.
* **Indistinguishability:** `K` must be indistinguishable from a random key to outsiders.
* **Robustness:** Even if some values leak, `sk` remains secure.
* **Efficiency:** Symmetric encryption with `K` is much faster than directly encrypting data with public-key cryptography.

---

## 6. Applications of KEM

* **TLS 1.3 / HTTPS:** Used for session key establishment.
* **Post-quantum cryptography:** KEMs like Kyber, NewHope are NIST finalists.
* **VPNs / SSH:** Establish secure channels with shared session keys.
* **Hybrid encryption schemes:** Public key (KEM) + Symmetric key (DEM, Data Encapsulation Mechanism).

---

## 7. Example (RSA-KEM)

1. Receiver: Generate `(pk, sk)` via RSA.
2. Sender: Picks random value `r`, encrypts with `pk` → `c`.
3. Both derive session key `K = Hash(r)`.
4. Receiver decrypts `c` with `sk` to get `r`, derives same `K`.
